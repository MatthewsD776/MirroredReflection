# Me, Myself and I

## Life in a nutshell

Born and raised in Kent, Gillingham to be exact. Then went to Royal Holloway University in Egham. Now living in Cambridge working as a Software Engineer at Citrix. Working within the Localisation team I get to experience many different languages and cultures. I can speak many languages and can almost form a sentence in most of them!
